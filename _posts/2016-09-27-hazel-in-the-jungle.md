Lately we've been noticing Hazel beginning to show signs of transitioning from uninterested potato to excitedly engaged meatsack. Not only does she make more amused (and amusing) faces at mom and dad, but when plopped into her jungle place or underneath a spinning animal-mobile, she goes wild. It's really nice to see her so stimulated and delighted by her environment.

Pretty soon she'll start learning how to eat it too.
