Hazel has been enjoying time with her maternal grandparents, lately. They are visiting from Chicago, and have been helping out around the house, producing yummy foods, and keeping us company.

Last weekend Mrs. Chen's brother and his family joined us. We dined at an excellent Vietnamese buffet in South San Jose. It was Hazel's longest outing to date. She slept through most of it.
